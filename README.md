![demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c217ccc-eb66-44ab-bac5-241a6da54dc0)

made for php 8.4.1 +

reply function. images expand on click. sqlite3 db. 

Will do soon- implement a few security measures (and it will still not be secure, its php)

make a seperate file for moderation (so there is an option to not even have a front facing mod area, makes it more secure) but keep in mind any sqlite3 db can be edited with any sqlite editor so moderation functions are not even needed.
