made for php 8.4.1 +

minimal deps- GD and sqlite3 

So simple a whale could install it. it makes the db and necessary directories when you visit index.php the first time from a browser. 

Implemented- 
Pagination, reply function, images expand on click, sqlite3 db. 




 # to do:: 

Will do soon- implement a few (about 10) security measures (and it will still not be secure, its php)

 
make a seperate file for moderation (so there is an option to not even have a front facing mod area, makes it more secure) but keep in mind any sqlite3 db can be edited with any sqlite editor so moderation functions are not even needed.
